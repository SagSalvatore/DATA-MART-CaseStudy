# DATA-MART-CaseStudy
Data Cleaning, Data Exploration 
Data Mart is the latest venture and Client want my help to analyze the sales and 
performance of the venture. In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made 
at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in 
every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.
Client asked the help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for 
Data Mart and its separate business areas.
